    This serializer handles converting between Pipecat frames and Asterisk's WebSocket
    channel events/commands and binary audio data and vice versa.
        Asterisk to Pipecat:
            - when DTMF detected on Asterisk websocket channel we send InputDTMFFrame to Pipecat.
            - when MEDIA_START event is received we send InputTransportMessageFrame to Pipecat with the event message as the payload,
                so the pipeline can use the information provided in that event (e.g., channel variables) and also know when the media starts flowing.
            - when MEDIA_XOFF event is received we log a warning that Asterisk is asking us to pause sending media, normally it should not happen if the transport implements flow control correctly.
            - when MEDIA_XON event is received we log that Asterisk is ready to receive media again after a MEDIA_XOFF event, again it's for information, it's not used.
            - when QUEUE_DRAINED event is received we send InputTransportMessageFrame to Pipecat with the event message as the payload,
                so the pipeline can know when Asterisk finished processing all the queued media, which might be useful to know when Asterisk finished playing all the TTS audio.
            - when binary audio data is received on Asterisk websocket channel we convert it to InputAudioRawFrame and send to Pipecat, after resampling if needed.
        Pipecat to Asterisk:
            - when an EndFrame or CancelFrame is processed we send HANGUP to Asterisk websocket channel.
            - when an InterruptionFrame is processed we send FLUSH_MEDIA to Asterisk websocket channel.
            - when an OutputAudioRawFrame is processed we send the raw audio bytes to Asterisk websocket channel, after resampling if needed.

        Some of the event handlers are just placeholders for now, they just log the received events, but they can be extended if needed.
        In case you need to add more event handlers you can add more methods with the naming convention "_ev_{event_name.lower()}"
        and they will be called automatically when the corresponding event is received from Asterisk.
        The same applies for frame handlers, you can add more methods with the naming convention "_frame_{frame_type.lower()}"
        and they will be called automatically when the corresponding frame type is processed in serialize method.
